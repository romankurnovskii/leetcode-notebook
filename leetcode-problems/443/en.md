## Description

Given an array of characters chars, compress it in-place. The length after compression must always be less than or equal to the original array.

Example:
```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
```

Constraints:
```
- 1 <= chars.length <= 2000
- chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
```

## Hint

> Use two pointers: one for reading, one for writing.

## Explanation

We want to compress the string by replacing sequences of the same character with that character followed by the count. We use two pointers: one to read through the array, and one to write the compressed result.

We do this because it lets us modify the array in-place, which saves memory and meets the problem's requirements. By counting consecutive characters and writing the count only when needed, we keep the result as short as possible.

This approach is efficient and avoids creating extra arrays, making it suitable for large inputs.

## Solution

```python
def compress(chars):
    write = 0
    read = 0
    n = len(chars)
    while read < n:
        char = chars[read]
        count = 0
        while read < n and chars[read] == char:
            read += 1
            count += 1
        chars[write] = char
        write += 1
        if count > 1:
            for c in str(count):
                chars[write] = c
                write += 1
    return write
```
